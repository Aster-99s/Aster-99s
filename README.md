## üöÄ About Me

I'm a software engineer with a Master's in Quantum Computation and a passion for solving challenging problems. My journey started with system administration and has evolved into a unique career at the intersection of three exciting fields. I thrive on automating workflows, uncovering data-driven insights with AI, and exploring the future of computing with quantum mechanics.

My goal? To leverage technology to build efficient, intelligent, and resilient solutions. Whether it's deploying a containerized application or benchmarking a quantum circuit on a noisy simulator, I bring a rigorous, analytical, and creative approach to every project.

## üî¨ Featured Work & Projects

Here are a few projects that highlight my skills and interests.

<details>
<summary><strong>üß¨ VQE_Benchmark: A Quantum Optimizer Benchmarking Suite</strong></summary>

> A comprehensive research framework I developed to systematically evaluate 7 classical optimizers against Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms. It runs on both statevector and noisy quantum simulators (like `FakeCairo`) to test performance under realistic conditions.

- **Key Achievement:** Discovered that the AQNGD optimizer had a **439x lower noise degradation factor** compared to gradient-based methods, providing crucial insights for NISQ-era hardware.
- **Tech Stack:** `Python`, `Qiskit`, `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`
- **[Explore the Repository & Research](https://github.com/Aster-99s/VQE_Benchmark)**

<summary><strong>üîç Clustering-Search-Terms: Semantic Analysis Pipeline</strong></summary>

> A practical NLP pipeline developed for a freelance client to improve marketing strategy. It uses transformer models (BERT) to semantically cluster raw search terms from ad campaigns, revealing underlying user intent.

- **Key Achievement:** Provided actionable insights that helped refine marketing spend by identifying high-value customer interest groups.
- **Tech Stack:** `Python`, `HuggingFace Transformers`, `Sentence-Transformers`, `Scikit-learn`
- **[See the Code](https://github.com/Aster-99s/Clustring-Search-terms)**
